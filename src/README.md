# Suite Caches: a Suite of Sweet Caches for Benchmarking
---

Suite Caches is a cache benchmarking tool written in Rust. Every aspect of this tool is intended to be flexible: addressable memory
space, cache replacement policy, cache associativity, and so on. While early iterations of this project are likely to be simple
TUIs, the final release will include a GUI that allows parameters to be edited visually.
