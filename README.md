# Suite Caches: A Suite of Sweet Caches

Captured by the concept of caches? Then you're in the right place. **Suite Caches** offers an endlessly customizable cache interface, 
with every parameter from associativity to eviction policy available to the programmer. Additionally, **Suite Caches** supports
an elementary scripting language made for benchmarking, making it easier than ever before to write benchmarks and gather
statistics.

This project also serves a dual purpose of providing an opportunity to learn Rust! As of the time of this project, this project was
not written by a Rustacean. If some bit of code does not look particularly Rusty, I'd love to learn what could change to make it
more appropriate! Feel free to make issues or pull requests that help refine particular code sections.
